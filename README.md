# Introduction
Companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Spaces Xâ€™s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars. other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, the aim of this project is to determine if the first stage will land with the aid of machine learning. The objectives of this task are:
- To determine if the first stage will land will land Successfully
- To determine the price of each launch.
- To determine the most important features that will determine a successful landing.
